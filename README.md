# Data-Warehousing-and-BI-Analytics-Project
# Project Description
This project is part of IBM Data Engineering course on coursera. You are a data engineer hired by a solid waste management company. The company collects and recycles solid waste across major cities in the country of Brazil. The company operates hundreds of trucks of different types to collect and transport solid waste. The company would like to create a data warehouse so that it can create reports like:
- Total waste collected per year per city
- Total waste collected per month per city
- Total waste collected per quarter per city
- Total waste collected per year per truck type
- Total waste collected per truck type per city
- Total waste collected per truck type per station per city
# Tools used
- IBM Cognos Analytics business intelligence and analytics software
